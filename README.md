<h1 align="center">INVERSE COOKING-Recipe Generation from Food Images‚Äù</h1>

### Description
In this project introduces an inverse cooking system that takes a food image and recreate a cooking recipes consisting of a title, ingredients, sequence of cooking instructions, Calorie, Cooking time.
This model predicts ingredients as sets by means of `DenseNet201` and `Recipe Retrieval Algorithm`. Generates cooking instructions by attending to both image and its inferred ingredients simultaneously.


### Dataset
The recipes from the website are scraped and saved as a JSON file, google_images_download library is used to download images. For each recipe 10 images are downloaded for training and 2 for testing. </br>
A total of 9432 images are downloaded (7860 train and 1572 test)


### Workflow Diagram
There is no real time web portal available to predict the food based on uploaded image. Currently entertainment portal like YouTube are used to find the recipe of a food item but it  only works while we know the name of the food item.
