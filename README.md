<h1 align="center">INVERSE COOKING-Recipe Generation from Food Images‚Äù</h1>

### Description
In this project introduces an inverse cooking system that takes a food image and recreate a cooking recipes consisting of a title, ingredients, sequence of cooking instructions, Calorie, Cooking time.
This model predicts ingredients as sets by means of `DenseNet201` and `Recipe Retrieval Algorithm`. Generates cooking instructions by attending to both image and its inferred ingredients simultaneously.


### Functionalities
- User can `Upload Photos`.
- User can `Take live photos`.
- Model predicts `Cooking Recipe of the upload image`.


### Workflow Diagram
There is no real time web portal available to predict the food based on uploaded image. Currently entertainment portal like YouTube are used to find the recipe of a food item but it  only works while we know the name of the food item.
